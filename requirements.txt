# Video Requirements Checklist
# This file defines the requirements for all videos created in this project
# Check these requirements before rendering any video

## Video Quality Standards
- HD Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080)
- Frame Rate: 30 FPS minimum
- Audio Quality: 48kHz, stereo
- Video Format: MP4 (H.264)

## Visual Design Guidelines
- No bold/aggressive colors - use professional, muted color palette
- Consistent branding and typography
- Clean, educational presentation suitable for YouTube teaching content
- Professional color scheme (blues, grays, whites, subtle accents)
- Avoid neon/flashy colors that might distract from educational content

## Frame Layout and Spacing Requirements
- **Frame Size**: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Safe Margins**: 80-100px padding from all edges
- **ALL elements must stay within frame bounds - no overflow**
- **Test all animations to ensure they don't overflow the frame**
- **Icons and images must be properly sized and positioned**

## Vertical Space Utilization
- **Use full vertical space (1080px height)**
- **Headers/Titles must be clearly visible at top**
- **Minimum 80px top padding for headers**
- **Distribute content evenly across vertical space**
- **Leave 80-100px bottom margin**

## Component Spacing Rules
- **Between components**: Minimum 40-60px vertical gap
- **Between sections**: 80-120px vertical gap
- **Layer spacing**: 180-220px between stacked elements
- **Card spacing**: 40-50px horizontal gap between cards
- **Text line height**: 1.4x minimum for readability

## Element Sizing
- **Headers/Titles**: 65-90px font size, always visible at top
- **Body text**: 24-38px font size
- **Icons**: 50-70px (no larger than 80px)
- **Cards/Boxes**: Max width 500px for single cards
- **Layer components**: Max width 900px

## Overlap Prevention
- **NO elements should overlap** (text, images, boxes, animations)
- **Each component needs dedicated vertical space**
- **Arrows/connectors must be positioned between elements, not overlapping**
- **Use absolute positioning with clear y-coordinates**
- **Test at all animation keyframes for overlap**
